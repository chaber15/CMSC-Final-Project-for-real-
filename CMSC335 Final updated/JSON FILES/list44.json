The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction.
