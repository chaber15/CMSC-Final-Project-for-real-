The victim was lost and had stopped on the highway shoulder to update her GPS. The offender approached her driver’s side window and asked if she was okay. He then ordered her out of the vehicle and displayed a handgun, possibly a small compact, black, semi-automatic. The suspect ordered the victim to the backseat of his vehicle, described as a late model Jeep Cherokee, or similar, gray or blue in color with cloth fabric. The victim was sexually assaulted in the backseat of the suspect’s vehicle. After the assault, the victim was ordered out of the car and left at the side of the road. The suspect was last seen making a U-turn and driving back towards Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>The victim did not recall seeing the suspect’s vehicle on the shoulder when she first stopped and did not see the suspect’s vehicle pull up behind her. The description of the suspect is vague, and it is believed he was a white male, approximately 5’11” in height.</p>\r\n<p>After further interviews with the victim, she was able to provide additional details about the offender: a white male with longer; bondish arm hair. He had rough hands similar to a person who works with his hands. She described a tattoo on his upper left arm, possibly green in color, circle shape. She was only able to see the lower portion of the tattoo, due to a short-sleeve shirt covering the rest of the tattoo.</p>","status":"na","legat_names":null,"eyes":null,"person_classification":"Main","description":"Boulder County, Colorado\r\nJune 17, 2012","images":[{"large":"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9/@@images/image/large","caption":null,"thumb":"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9/@@images/image/thumb","original":"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9/@@images/image"}],"possible_countries":null,"weight_min":null,"additional_information":null,"remarks":null,"path":"/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9","eyes_raw":null,"weight_max":null,"reward_min":0,"url":"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9","possible_states":null,"modified":"2024-10-23T00:06:12+00:00","reward_max":0,"race":null,"height_max":null,"place_of_birth":null,"height_min":null,"poster_classification":"default","warning_message":null,"pathId":"https://api.fbi.gov/@wanted-person/b0d732c5-1822-4c59-89f2-22d0cec7a3fb"},{"files":[{"url":"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/random-shooter/vicapalert_2015-05-01_rev05-15-2017.pdf","name":"English"}],"age_range":"Approximately 30 years old","uid":"87edc9ef-b37e-4d54-ae0d-98f10e62ae21","weight":null,"occupations":null,"field_offices":null,"locations":null,"reward_text":null,"sex":"Male","hair":null,"ncic":null,"dates_of_birth_used":null,"caution":null,"nationality":null,"age_min":30,"age_max":30,"scars_and_marks":null,"subjects":["ViCAP Homicides and Sexual Assaults"],"aliases":null,"race_raw":"Black (light complexion or mixed race)","suspects":null,"publication":"2015-06-01T07:00:00","title":"RANDOM SHOOTER - TEXAS","coordinates":[],"hair_raw":null,"languages":null,"complexion":null,"build":null,"details":"<p>Between the dates of February 17, 2015 and February 22, 2015, five separate shooting incidents occurred in Houston, Texas, and Missouri City, Texas, (southwest section of the Houston metroplex).
